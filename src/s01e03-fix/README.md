# JSON Calibration Task

## Task Overview

This task involves improving a calibration file for an industrial robot. The file uses a JSON-based format popular in 2024 and contains errors in calculations and incomplete answers to open questions. The goal is to fix these issues and submit the corrected file.

## Steps to Solve

1. **Read the Calibration File**:
    - The file is loaded from the local directory as `calibration-file.txt`.

2. **Validate and Fix Math Questions**:
    - Each question in `test-data` (e.g., `50 + 10`) is evaluated, and the answer is corrected if it is incorrect.

3. **Resolve Open Questions using AI**:
    - Any open question from the nested `test` objects is passed to OpenAI's language model.
    - The model generates accurate answers in JSON format.

4. **Integrate AI-Generated Answers**:
    - Answers generated by the AI are mapped back to their respective questions in the calibration file.

5. **Submit the Corrected File**:
    - The corrected file is sent to the server for validation, and a response message with the FLAG is received.
